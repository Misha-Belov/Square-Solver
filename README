This program solves quoter quantities.

To compile it write make -f MakeFile. To start it write \SolverSquare.exe.
If you want to read some quantities from file, write --file and name of the file after \SolverSquare.exe.
Then you will see inscription, you should type 1 if you want to do tests from test.txt or 2 if you want to input coefficients by yourself.
Answer includes number of roots and roots.
If you started tests, you will see inputed coefficients, expected roots and name of test. If test was done correctly, inscription will be green, otherwise it will become red. After this you will see number of tests that was done correctly.
